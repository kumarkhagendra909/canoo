First step using scrapy framework 
then decided to scrape data from finance.yahoo.com/quote/GOEV
then will see a menubar like a navbar having
[
{"link": "/quote/GOEV"} basically this last one was summary,
{"link": "/quote/GOEV/news"},
{"link": "/quote/GOEV/chart"},
{"link": "/quote/GOEV/community"},
{"link": "/quote/GOEV/key-statistics"},
{"link": "/quote/GOEV/history"},
{"link": "/quote/GOEV/profile"},
{"link": "/quote/GOEV/financials"},
{"link": "/quote/GOEV/analysis"},
{"link": "/quote/GOEV/options"},
{"link": "/quote/GOEV/holders"},
{"link": "/quote/GOEV/sustainability"}
]

so to get the links of all the have to write correct response.css CSSSELECTOR
and yield out it and save it 
and also we need to visit each site for later study as we need to know about the company and all 
and key player from where i can get that ?
